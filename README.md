# Sorting Algorithms Project


## Description

This project implements 3 types of sorting algorithms, namely: Selection sort, Merge Sort and Quick Sort. It is used to sort the list of numbers in the ascending order.


## How to Run 

Algorithms are written in separate main java classes, so in order to run the program, a specific algorithm needs to be run separately. 

The program will sort as many numbers as the user adds to the list, unless the list size is too large which computer couldn't handle it. 

The number of inputs can be changed by increasing or decreasing the number of iterations of the loop. The size of the numbers that will be entered in the list are also changed within the for-loop.

for(int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
             list.add(rand.nextInt(5) + 1);
         }

i < 10 -> list size is 10
rand.nextInt(5) + 1 -> Generate numbers from 1 to 5

## Expected Outputs

1. Unsorted List
2. Sorted List in the ascending order 
3. List size
4. Number of operations 
5. Time Complexity of the Algorithm
